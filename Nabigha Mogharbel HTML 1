    <hr>
    <p> Today was an amazing day. We went to Arz El Rab at Bcharri, North Lebanon. This place is one of many natural
        reserves in Lebanon. It's covered in Cedars trees, or 
        scientifically knows as <i>Cedrus libanis</i>.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The road to Arz El Rab reserve has breath-taking view where you drive along Qadisha valley. Before reaching the
        entrance,
        we found plenty of small shops that sell antiques and handmade crafts for visitors.</p>
    
    <p>The reserve felt like a <b>huge pit</b>, the walking paths follows a gradually desecnding direction and forms
        spiral shapes to the reserve's center.</p>
    <p>Although the reserve is almost exclusively covered with cedars, there was a noticable <a href="#tree">white tree
            trunk</a> that stands out from the rest of the reserve. I was curious to know more about it, but I couldn't ask because we had to leave early.</p>
    <p>Luckily, I was able to take some photos of this reserve. I have put my top 3 pictures in the <a href="#album">photo album </a>.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In general, it was really enjoyable and memorable trip. I will defenitly visit Arz El Rab reserve again.</p>
